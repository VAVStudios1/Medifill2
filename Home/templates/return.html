                    <li>b. Exceeding of the credit/debit limit mutually agreed between the User and the issuing bank.</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>6. MediFill reserves the right to impose limits on the number of transactions a User may undertake over the Website. Should the User exceed such transaction limits imposed by MediFill, MediFill reserves the right to refuse to process such transactions. MediFill may refuse to process transactions emanating from User(s) who have suspicious or questionable transaction history on the Website. Should MediFill be dissatisfied with the credibility of a User or the genuineness of a transaction carried out on the Website, MediFill shall have the right to reject such transactions. MediFill may also choose to delay the dispatch of Products purchased by such User or cancel the entire purchase at its sole discretion. The User agrees that MediFill shall not be liable for any damage, interests or claims resulting from MediFill’s decision to not process a transaction or delay in the processing of a transaction on account of a User’s suspicious activity on the Website.</li>
            <li>7. All the Products listed on the Platform are inclusive of all applicable taxes. You will be responsible for payment of all fees/costs/charges associated with the purchase of Products from us and you agree to bear any and all applicable taxes including but not limited to VAT/CST, service tax, GST, duties and cesses etc. Despite MediFill’s best efforts, there may be instances of mispricing of Products on the Website during or after the process of purchase of Products has been carried out by the User. While thorough processes of verification is carried out prior to the publication of Product prices on the Website, errors and discrepancies arising out of technical glitches and time lags are unavoidable. For avoidance of doubt, MediFill’s curative actions that will arise in the event of a price difference arising on the actual maximum retail price of a Products against the price published on the Website is set out below:
                <ul>
                    <li>i. If the maximum retail price of the Products delivered to the User is lower than the price published on the Website, the User shall, within 2 (two) days from the time when he/she received the Products, intimate us at cs@medifill.com / 7200712345 in each case resulting in an acknowledgment. Upon MediFill being satisfied of the User’s claim, the difference amount in the purchase price against the maximum retail price shall be refunded to User’s Wallet account or transferred to the User’s bank account within 10 (ten) to 12 (twelve) working days from the date of receiving the written request from the User.</li>
                    <li>ii. If the maximum retail price of the Products listed on the Website is higher than what has been published and if MediFill is not providing an offer or discount on such Products, MediFill shall have the right to reserve the despatch of the purchased Products until the error on the Website have been rectified and the User pays the difference amount. If the User refuses to pay the difference amount, the User is entitled to seek a cancellation and the amount paid by the User shall be refunded to Wallet account or transferred into the User’s bank account within 10 (ten) working days by MediFill.</li>
                    <li>iii. In order to process such refunds, the User will be required to send an email to us at cs@medifill.com providing the details of the bank account where the amount needs to be refunded. Thereafter, the User will receive a refund if the initial mode of payment for the order was ‘cash on delivery’ on users account through net banking. If the initial mode of payment for the order was through a payment option other than the ‘cash on delivery’ option, we may transfer the refund to the User’s source account, which was used to make the initial payment.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>8. To enable User to make payments for purchasing Products on the Website, in addition to this FPP Policy, the terms and conditions of the User’s bank, applicable financial institution and/or card issuing association may be applicable. The User’s bank, financial institution or card issuing association may decline or prevent the User from making electronic payments for buying the Products on the Website and MediFill does not control the same and hence, shall not be at any point in time be held liable.</li>
            <li>9. MediFill may, from time to time contract with third-party payment service providers including banks under applicable Indian laws.</li>
            <li>10. If it is brought to the User’s notice that a charge has been created on his/her payment instrument(s) for purchase of Products on the Website and the User is not aware of such purchase on the Website, the User is first, required to verify if his/her family members, friends or business colleagues were authorised to carry out the purchase of Products on the Website. If, despite this, the User continues to be unable to identify the charge created on his/her payment instrument(s) for purchase of Products on the Website, the User may report such unauthorised purchase to us within 2 (two) days from the date on which the unauthorised purchase was carried out on the Website in order to enable MediFill to initiate investigations.</li>
            <li>11. If the User carries out a purchase on the Website and the payment in lieu thereof has been invalidated, MediFill reserves the right to retrieve the invalidated payment (“Invalidated Payment”) from the User’s Wallet Account. Should the User have insufficient Wallet amount in order to facilitate such redemption of the invalidated payment, the User shall within 2 (two) to 4 (four) working days from the date of receiving a written notice from MediFill, remit the Invalidated Payment into MediFill’s bank account, details of which shall be set out in the notice. If the User fails to remit the Invalidated Payment into MediFill’s bank account despite having received the notice, MediFill shall be entitled to initiate civil and/or criminal legal action against the defaulting User at his/her cost and peril.</li>
            <li>12. The ‘cash on delivery’ payment option allows Users to make a cash-only payment to our delivery executive or logistic partner at the time of delivery of the purchased Products to the User. Presently, we offer a maximum order value of INR 10,000 (Indian Rupees Ten Thousand) under the cash on delivery payment option. MediFill reserves the right not to provide the option of cash on delivery payment for certain Products (these could be Products specified by MediFill or Products with value exceeding a specified amount) or locations. User(s) are required to peruse and accept the terms set out under the Return Refund and Cancellation Policy which sets out the terms of refunds for transactions carried out using the cash on delivery payment option.</li>
            <li>13. MediFill Wallet: If a User cancels an order for which payment has already been made to MediFill, the User shall have an option to convert the amount paid towards the order into MediFill Wallet. In addition, any and all refunds with respect to Products purchased through the ‘cash on delivery’ payment option will be transferred as MediFill Wallet into the User’s Wallet account and in the event of the User expressing his/her intention to deactivate his/her account then such unused Wallet amount will be transferred to the source account. MediFill may at its sole discretion, issue MediFill Wallet to users. The Wallets can be used by the user for future purchases only on the Website. In the event of a User wishing to deactivate his/her account with MediFill, the User agrees that all Wallet granted by MediFill available on the User’s Wallet account, if any, will automatically stand forfeited, and MediFill will not be required to process any refunds in any manner whatsoever. The User therefore agrees to use and exhaust any existing Wallet prior to requesting for a deactivation of his/her account on the Website. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any refund of Wallet to the User’s wallet account will be at the sole discretion of MediFill. If MediFill suspects any fraudulent activities, MediFill reserves its right to hold back transfer of any Wallet to User’s Wallet account.</li>
